Marco Uderzo earned his Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a Master’s degree in Data Science at the University of Padova, Italy, where he developed a strong interest in deep learning, molecular biology, and computational biology. In 2024, he spent a semester at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 through the Erasmus program, focusing on genomics, before joining Zayna Chaker’s lab at the Institute of Functional Genomics of Lyon (IGFL) for his Master’s internship and thesis. He is now a PhD Student in Computational Neurobiology in the same lab. His research combines machine learning, spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell omics to study the spatial molecular landscapes of the two neurogenic niches of the adult mouse brain, aiming to identify both shared and distinct molecular mechanisms of adult neurogenesis.

Outside the lab, Marco loves creating art, playing the piano, hiking and skiing.
