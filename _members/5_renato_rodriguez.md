Renato studied Biology in Toulouse and did a Master’s in Cell and Molecular Biology. He then moved to Nantes where he did an internship at UMR703 PAnTher and worked with the APEX imaging platform on a gene therapy project for a rare lysosomal disease. Even though his background is in virology and gene therapy, he’s passionate about neuroscience and physiology, which brought him to IGFL in 2024.

His work in the Chaker lab consists in determining if pregnancy activates a developmental-like senescence program in the adult mother brain. He is investigating the mechanisms underlying the activation of such program and its functional relevance using advanced imaging and spatial transcriptomics approaches

Outside the lab Renato loves travelling, playing guitar, and football.
