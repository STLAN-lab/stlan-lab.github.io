We were delighted to participate in the FSSCR 2025 conference in Lyon! Amidst an inspiring lineup of talks and posters, we’re proud to highlight contributions from our team:

- Zayna’s talk — “Spatio-temporal logic of adult neurogenesis: a functional and evolutionary perspective”. Zayna introduced her new lab and showcased the PhD projects of Marco and Priya, which together address a central question in our research: "What are the cellular and molecular mechanisms that coordinate brain stem cells?"

- Renato’s first poster: “Striking the right balance: how do new neurons find their way to integrate in the maternal brain?”

- Violaine’s poster: “Adult neural stem cell recruitment following mating in zebrafish”
