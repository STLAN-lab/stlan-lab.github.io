In the lab, we are investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms allowing regionally-distinct pools of NSCs to coordinate their behavior in space (across niches) and time (from embryo to different phases in adulthood), under specific physiological and pathological conditions. Our work aims to better understand and eventually harness adult NSC potential, shedding new light onto the functional importance of adult neurogenesis for adaptive brain remodeling. We are following a developmental, comparative and circuit research perspective, using mouse and Zebrafish as two contrasting, yet complementary, model systems.
